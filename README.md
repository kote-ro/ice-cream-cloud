##### Here is the small description of projects:
- **discovery-service:** a Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka server, used for service discovery.
- **icecream-service:** a simple Ice Cream service that uses Spring Data REST to serve up a REST API of ice creams.
- **api-gateway:** an API gateway that has a /tasty-icecreams endpoint that talks to the icecream-service and filters out ice creams that arenâ€™t tasty.
